# Real-Time Location Tracking App

## Description

This project is a real-time location tracking web application. It uses geolocation data from users and updates their position on a map in real-time. As users move, their location is broadcasted to other users, and their marker on the map is updated accordingly. The app demonstrates how to leverage WebSockets for real-time communication and location sharing, built with Node.js, Express, Leaflet.js, and Socket.IO.

## Features
- Real-time geolocation tracking using browser's Geolocation API.
- Secure and fast communication with WebSockets via Socket.IO.
- Live map updates using Leaflet.js for mapping and display.
- User-friendly UI displaying current and connected users on the map.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Leaflet.js
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO
- **Other Tools:** Geolocation API, Leaflet.js, Socket.IO for real-time updates.
